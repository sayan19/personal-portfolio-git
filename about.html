                    Hi! I am Soumya Suman. I was born in Malaysia and raised in Abu Dhabi. I am currently a rising senior at Boston University with a major in Computer Engineering (CE). I am also concentrating in Technology Innovation and minoring in Innovation and Entrepreneurship. I am passionate about the intersection between technology and business and aspire to pursue product management as my career.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My interest in CE originally began while building various hands-on engineering projects with Lego Mindstorm Robotics back in high school. The way different sensors work with each other fascinated me a lot. Since high school I have always been a proactive leader. I formed the first ever Mathematics club during my senior year, which enabled our school to take part in different mathematics competitions with other schools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since Freshman year at Boston University, I have built upon my enthusiasm for leading various projects in my classes and clubs. During my Sophomore year, I was elected Vice President of BU Augmented and Virtual Reality Club. In this role, I was responsible for organizing a novel AR/VR festival, which gave my peers and I opportunities to interact with different companies in the field and learn about how they operate. In my Junior Year, I was also elected Vice President of BU Racing Club and under my leadership, we successfully built our first electric race car.

                </p>
                <p>
                    I have realized from my club leadership and project experiences that I greatly enjoy guiding and working with my peers and colleagues to transform an initial idea into a final product. I aspire to apply these experiences and my technical skills to launch exciting products in the real world as a Product Manager.
